## Sample code for Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift, to be used as an "s2i" example

[Developer Sandbox for Red Het OpenShift](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox/get-started) gives you a renewable 30-day free access to an OpenShift cluster.

One of the activities associated with this free cluster is the ability to build an application using OpenShift's built-in sourc-to-image (s2i) technology. This technology pulls source code from a git repository and builds an application.

This sandbox-php repo, written in Python (using the django framework), supports that example (i.e. s2i) for developers that are interested in the Python programming language.
